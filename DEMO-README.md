# 🚨 Baseline Enforcement Demo

**First GitHub Action to support official Baseline queries - STRICT ENFORCEMENT MODE!**

This demo branch showcases **real enforcement capabilities** with violations that will trigger policy failures.

## 🎯 What This Demo Shows

🚨 **STRICT Enforcement** with `baseline widely available`:
- Contains cutting-edge features that **WILL trigger violations**
- Demonstrates real policy enforcement in action
- Shows build failures and remediation guidance

🆕 **Official Baseline Queries** in action:
- `baseline widely available` → **STRICT enforcement mode**
- Auto-detects risky features and enforces compliance
- Zero-config auto-setup from `.browserslistrc`

🔍 **Real Violations Demonstrated**:
- CSS Nesting syntax
- Container Queries
- View Transitions API
- CSS Anchor Positioning
- Web Locks API
- Advanced backdrop-filter
- Origin Private File System

## 🚀 Try the Enforcement Demo

### 1. Fork & Run
```bash
# Fork this repository
# The demo will automatically fail due to violations
git checkout demo
git push origin demo  # Triggers workflow with violations
```

### 2. Watch the Enforcement
- ❌ **Build FAILS** due to violations (this is expected!)
- 📊 **SARIF report** generated with specific findings
- 🔧 **Remediation guidance** provided for each violation
- 📝 **Detailed reports** explain what needs to be fixed

```

## 🚨 Expected Violations

### ❌ CSS Violations
- **CSS Nesting**: `.parent { .child { } }` syntax
- **Container Queries**: `@container` rules
- **Anchor Positioning**: `anchor-name`, `top: anchor()`
- **View Transitions**: `view-transition-name`
- **Advanced backdrop-filter**: Complex filter combinations

### ❌ JavaScript Violations  
- **View Transitions API**: `document.startViewTransition()`
- **Web Locks API**: `navigator.locks.request()`
- **Origin Private FS**: `navigator.storage.getDirectory()`
- **SharedArrayBuffer**: Limited cross-origin support
- **Advanced Array methods**: `findLast()`, `findLastIndex()`

## 📊 Enforcement Configuration

Our strict `.browserslistrc`:
```
baseline widely available
```

**Auto-generates strict enforcement:**
```json
{
  "enforcement": {
    "mode": "per-feature",
    "baseline-threshold": "widely",
    "max-violations": 0,
    "enforcement-mode": "error"
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Demo Outcomes

When you run this demo:

### ❌ **Build Fails** (Expected!)
```
Found 8+ Baseline compliance violations
Enforcement mode: error
Max violations: 0
Result: BUILD FAILED ❌
```

### 📊 **SARIF Report Generated**
- Uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Contains specific violation details
- Includes remediation guidance
- Professional security integration

### 📝 **Detailed Violation Report**
```markdown
## ❌ Baseline Compliance Violations

### CSS Violations:
- Line 23: CSS Nesting syntax not widely available
- Line 45: Container queries limited support
- Line 67: View transitions experimental

### JavaScript Violations:
- Line 12: Web Locks API limited support
- Line 34: Origin Private FS experimental
```

## 🛡️ Enforcement Value Demonstration

1. **🚫 Prevents Risky Code**: Blocks experimental features from production
2. **📋 Clear Guidance**: Explains exactly what needs to be fixed
3. **🔒 Policy Compliance**: Enforces organizational standards
4. **🎯 Zero Config**: Works automatically from browserslist
5. **📊 Professional Integration**: SARIF reports in GitHub Security

## 🆚 Comparison Demo

Want to see the difference? Compare this strict enforcement demo with a passing demo by changing `.browserslistrc` to:

```
# More permissive
baseline newly available
```

**Result**: Most violations become warnings, build passes with notifications.

## 🎉 Ready for Production Use?

This demo proves the action works as a **real compliance gatekeeper**. For your projects:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/baseline.yml
- uses: Aristide021/baseline@v1.0.0
  with:
    baseline-threshold: 'widely'  # or 'newly' for less strict
    max-violations: 0            # Fail on any violations
```

**Your code must be Baseline compliant to deploy!** 🛡️
