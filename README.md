# Baseline GitHub Action

Automatically enforce web platform feature compatibility standards in your CI/CD pipeline. Unlike existing linting tools that provide suggestions, Baseline acts as a compliance gatekeeper, preventing non-compliant code from reaching production environments.

> 🚀 **Demo Update**: Enhanced with mapping coverage intelligence and comprehensive scan metrics!

## Features

- 🆕 **Official Baseline Queries**: First GitHub Action to support the new web.dev Baseline syntax (`baseline 2022`, `baseline widely available`)
- 🔍 **Comprehensive Feature Detection**: Analyzes CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files for web platform features
- 🧩 **Framework Support**: Native support for React (.jsx/.tsx), Vue (.vue), Svelte (.svelte), and TypeScript
- 📊 **Baseline Status Resolution**: Queries web-features data to determine compatibility status  
- 🛡️ **Intelligent Policy Enforcement**: Auto-configures enforcement from official Baseline queries with 4 enforcement modes
- 📄 **Detailed Reporting**: Generates violation reports with remediation guidance
- 🔗 **GitHub Integration**: Provides status checks, PR comments, and workflow controls
- ⚡ **Performance Optimized**: Caches Baseline data and analyzes only changed files
- 🛠️ **Highly Configurable**: Supports browserslist integration and custom rules

## Official Baseline Queries Support 🆕

**First GitHub Action to support the new official Baseline syntax!**

Building on the emerging Browserslist Baseline query support, this action automatically detects and intelligently configures enforcement based on these official queries.

### Supported Queries

```
# .browserslistrc
baseline widely available     # 30+ months interoperable
baseline newly available      # ≤30 months interoperable  
baseline 2022                # Features from 2022 and older
baseline widely available on 2024-06-06  # Specific date
```

### Auto-Configuration

| Query Type | Enforcement Mode | Effect |
|------------|------------------|--------|
| `baseline 2022` | `yearly` | Age-based rules: 3+ years=error, 2+ years=warn |
| `baseline widely available` | `per-feature` | Strict threshold=widely |
| `baseline newly available` | `per-feature` | Balanced threshold=newly |

### Example Usage

```yaml
# .browserslistrc
baseline 2022

# No additional configuration needed!
# Action auto-configures yearly enforcement
```

**Result:** Features from 2022+ are enforced based on age, with 2022 features marked as errors and newer features as warnings or info.

  uses: Aristide021/baseline@v1.0.0
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    output-format: 'sarif'           # Primary output as SARIF
    sarif-output: 'security/baseline.sarif'  # Additional SARIF for security tab

- name: Upload to Security Tab
  uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  if: always()

| `report-path` | Path to the generated report file |

### Adaptive Yearly Enforcement (Automatic)

When a Browserslist Baseline year query (e.g. `baseline 2022`) is detected, the action synthesizes year-based rules:

| Age (years) | Generated Level | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| >= 3 | error | Feature considered mature — deviations are high risk |
| >= 2 | warn  | Transition period — surface but don’t block |
| >= 1 | info  | Emerging stability — informational only |
| < 1 | off   | Too new for enforcement |

Pseudo-algorithm:
```
for each detectedYear:
  age = currentYear - detectedYear
  if age >= 3: rule[year] = 'error'
  else if age >= 2: rule[year] = 'warn'
  else if age >= 1: rule[year] = 'info'
  else: rule[year] = 'off'
augment older missing years as 'error'
extend forward years as 'off' / 'info'
```

These rules combine with per-feature Baseline status checks to form a hybrid adaptive policy without manual configuration.

### Deterministic Exit Codes

Baseline sets predictable exit codes for CI scripting:

| Code | Meaning | Condition |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 0 | Success | No violations exceeding thresholds |
| 1 | Violations | At least one violation (no high severity) and enforcement triggered |
| 2 | High severity violations | One or more high severity violations present |

> Note: High severity is determined by policy engine classification (e.g., older year / stricter threshold breaches). Code `2` is preserved by avoiding `core.setFailed` so downstream composite actions can branch on it.

## Example Reports

When violations are found, the action generates detailed reports:

### PR Comment
![PR Comment Example](docs/images/pr-comment.png)

### Detailed Report
```markdown
## ❌ Baseline Compliance Check

Found **3** features that don't meet your Baseline threshold.

### Summary
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Violations | 3 |
| Compliance Score | 85% |
| High Severity | 1 🚨 |
| Medium Severity | 2 ⚠️ |

### Violations by File

#### `src/components/Modal.css`
- **Line 15**: CSS Container Queries 🚨
  - Current: 🔴 Limited
  - Required: 🟡 Newly Interoperable
  - Remediation: Use media queries as fallback

#### `src/utils/api.js`  
- **Line 23**: Fetch API ⚠️
  - Current: 🟡 Newly Interoperable
  - Required: 🟢 Widely Available
  - Remediation: Use polyfill or XMLHttpRequest fallback
```

## Remediation Guidance

The action provides specific remediation suggestions:

- **Polyfill recommendations** with package names
- **Alternative feature suggestions** for better compatibility
- **Progressive enhancement patterns** with code examples
